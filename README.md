# advent-of-code

## Description

These are my personal solutions to the [advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com)
procrastination shenanigans. Instead of having multiple repositories I prefer to
have them all in one.

Every year I might switch and try out a different language, that's why each year
has its own root and tooling.

## Nix

For setting up reproducible tooling and developer environments I use
[Nix](https://nixos.org/) and my personal
[tsandrini/practical-flakes-template](https://github.com/tsandrini/practical-flakes-template/)
template which you can find in every year. This makes it fairly easy to set up
radically different tooling every year.

## Solutions

- **2023**: Used OCaml [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) this year. Pretty good year,
  missed only the last problems.
- **2022**: Using Rust and [this](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust)
  template
